**IMPORTANT:** You can delete everything in here and start fresh. You might want to start by not deleting anything above this line until you know what that stuff is doing.

This is an `.Rmd` file. It is plain text with special features. Any time you write just like this, it will be compiled to normal text in the website. If you put a \# in front of your text, it will create a top level-header.

# My first post

Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

Notice that whatever you define as a top level header, automatically gets put into the table of contents bar on the left. 

## Second level header

You can add more headers by adding more hashtags. These won't be put into the table of contents

### third level header

Here's an even lower level header

# My second post (note the order)

Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

I'm writing this tutorial going from the top down. And, this is how it will be printed. So, notice the second post is second in the list. If you want your most recent post to be at the top, then make a new post starting at the top. If you want the oldest first, do, then keep adding to the bottom

# Adding R stuff

So far this is just a blog where you can write in plain text and serve your writing to a webpage. One of the main purposes of this lab journal is to record your progress learning R. The reason I am asking you to use this process is because you can both make a website, and a lab journal, and learn R all in R-studio. This makes everything really convenient and in the same place. 

So, let's say you are learning how to make a histogram in R. For example, maybe you want to sample 100 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 0, and standard deviation = 1, and then you want to plot a histogram. You can do this right here by using an r code block, like this:

```{r}
# Data Science at TUHH ------------------------------------------------------
# SALES ANALYSIS ----

# 1.0 Load libraries ----

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# 2.0 Importing Files ----
# A good convention is to use the file name and suffix it with tbl for the data structure tibble
bikes_tbl      <- read_excel(path = "DS_101/00_data/01_bike_sales/01_raw_data/bikes.xlsx")
orderlines_tbl <- read_excel("DS_101/00_data/01_bike_sales/01_raw_data/orderlines.xlsx")

# Not necessary for this analysis, but for the sake of completeness
bikeshops_tbl  <- read_excel("DS_101/00_data/01_bike_sales/01_raw_data/bikeshops.xlsx")

# 3.0 Examining Data ----

# Method 1: Print it to the console
orderlines_tbl

# Method 2: Clicking on the file in the environment tab (or run View(orderlines_tbl)) There you can play around with the filter.

# Method 3: glimpse() function. Especially helpful for wide data (data with many columns)
glimpse(orderlines_tbl)


# 4.0 Joining Data ----
bike_orderlines_joined_tbl <- orderlines_tbl %>%
  left_join(bikes_tbl, by = c("product.id" = "bike.id")) %>%
  left_join(bikeshops_tbl, by = c("customer.id" = "bikeshop.id"))
bike_orderlines_joined_tbl %>% glimpse()

# 5.0 Wrangling Data ----
# All actions are chained with the pipe already. You can perform each step separately and use glimpse() or View() to validate your code. Store the result in a variable at the end of the steps.
bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl <- bike_orderlines_joined_tbl %>%
  # 5.1 Separate category name
  separate(col    = location,
           into   = c("city", "state"),
           sep    = ",") %>%
  
  # 5.2 Add the total price (price * quantity) 
  # Add a column to a tibble that uses a formula-style calculation of other columns
  mutate(total.price = price * quantity) %>%
  
  # 5.3 Optional: Reorganize. Using select to grab or remove unnecessary columns
  # 5.3.1 by exact column name
  select(-...1, -gender) %>%
  
  # 5.3.2 by a pattern
  # You can use the select_helpers to define patterns. 
  # Type ?ends_with and click on Select helpers in the documentation
  select(-ends_with(".id")) %>%
  
  # 5.3.3 Actually we need the column "order.id". Let's bind it back to the data
  bind_cols(bike_orderlines_joined_tbl %>% select(order.id)) %>% 
  
  # 5.3.4 You can reorder the data by selecting the columns in your desired order.
  # You can use select_helpers like contains() or everything()
  select(order.id, contains("order"), contains("model"), contains("location"),
         price, quantity, total.price,
         everything()) %>%
  
  # 5.4 Rename columns because we actually wanted underscores instead of the dots
  # (one at the time vs. multiple at once)
  rename(bikeshop = name) %>%
